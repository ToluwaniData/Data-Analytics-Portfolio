# PostgreSQL – DVD Rental Data Analysis  

## 📘 Project Title  
PostgreSQL DVD Rental Data Analysis  

## 🗂️ Description  
This project explores data from a sample DVD rental database using PostgreSQL. The analysis demonstrates fundamental to intermediate SQL operations including data retrieval, filtering, joining tables, and performing aggregate queries to uncover insights about customer behavior, film categories, and rental trends.  

## 🧠 Key Learning Objectives  
1. Write basic SQL queries using SELECT, WHERE, and logical operators (AND, OR, LIKE).  
2. Apply JOINs to merge multiple tables such as CUSTOMER, RENTAL, FILM, and CATEGORY.  
3. Use aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, SUM) with GROUP BY and ORDER BY.  
4. Perform data-driven insights using real-world queries, such as finding top movies or identifying unreturned rentals.  

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Analysis  
1. The top 5 most rented films were identified using join and count logic.  
2. Store 2 had distinct customers with specific rental behaviors.  
3. Categories such as Action and Comedy were among the top 3 with the most movies.  
4. Several customers were found who had not returned rented movies yet.  
5. Calculated the total number of rentals in the last 30 days, showing recent activity trends.  

## ⚙️ SQL Features Used  
- SELECT, WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE  
- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN  
- GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT  
- Aggregate functions COUNT(), AVG()  
- Date filtering using CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL  

## 📁 Files Included  
- `Toluwani_Emmanuel.sql` – Full SQL script  
- `Screenshots folder` – Visuals of query results

## ✅ Outcome  
This project strengthened my understanding of SQL and relational databases. I successfully demonstrated how to extract, combine, and analyze data using PostgreSQL while gaining hands-on experience with joins, filtering, and aggregate operations to draw meaningful insights from real-world datasets.
